I like to work on various projects in my spare time to hone new skills and try out new technologies. Here are a few of my favorites!

Apartment Shrimp Aquarium
======
I keep freshwater shrimp (Neocaridina davidi) at my permanent address, and wanted to bring some with me to my college apartment. This meant designing an aquarium I could relatively easily drive with me across the country, in addition to designing a lighting system I could control very well. The code for the lighting system is as described [here](https://github.com/BeeGuyDude/Shrimp-Tower-Light), which also includes a link to the code for the [remote](https://github.com/BeeGuyDude/Shrimp-Tower-Remote) I made so me and my roommates could turn on the lighting system at night to look at the shrimp if we want.

L1 Certification Rocket
======
As a member of the Rocketry@VT design team, I was required to get my L1 high-powered rocketry certification within my first year on the team. Wanting to include electronics in the rocket, I designed it to be a dual-deploy system with a simple avionics bay, which I have since successfully built, launched, recovered, and used to get my certification.
